# Kerbal Training Experience

This mod adds training hours monitor to gain kerbalnauts' experience and level.

Different roles have different training requirements:
- **Pilot** can be trained by flying a plane or spaceship.
- **Engineer** and **Scientist** can be trained in surround orbit or escape orbit (take time to do some engineering practice/science experiments).
- **All kerbalnauts** need a KerbNet connection while training (to receive the professional guide from KSC), **or** a higher level kerbalnaut who has the same role and on the same vessel.
- While training without KerbNet connection, kerbalnauts **will not** get any more experience when no other kerbalnaut with same role, has a higher level than his/her level on the same vessel.

Total training time can be recorded when meets training condition. The necessary training time to get per single XP can be configured in difficulty settings.

Default setting under Normal difficulty is:
- Pilots get 1 XP per 36 training hours.
- Engineers and scientists get 1 XP per 18 training hours.
